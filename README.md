# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The Console
## AirBnB clone project

## Description
We are building a command interpreter to manage objects. All other parts of the project will use this as a base, so it's an essential component of it.

## How we built it:
* First, we built a parent class called BaseModel. 
* We create a flow to serialize and deserialize, Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file. 
* Classes for the project that inherit from BaseModel.
* First abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
* Create unittests to validate all classes and storage engine.

## How to use it?

Interactive mode:

$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):

EOF  help  quit

(hbnb)

Non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)
